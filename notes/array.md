unset() is a PHP function used to remove a variable or delete a specific element from an array. It is often used to free up memory or manage the structure of an array by removing unwanted elements.

An enumerated array in PHP, also known as an indexed array, is an array where the keys are numeric and sequential (starting from 0 by default). These arrays are often used to store ordered collections of elements where the position of the element is more important than its associated key.
