The HAVING clause in SQL is used with aggregate functions to filter the results of a query after grouping the data with GROUP BY. While the WHERE clause filters rows before the grouping occurs, the HAVING clause filters groups after the aggregation has been applied.


Difference Between IN and BETWEEN in SQL:
IN: Used to check if a value matches any value in a list of specified values.
BETWEEN: Used to filter the result set within a range of values (inclusive of the boundary values).



The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to arrange identical data into groups. It is often used with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), or MIN() to perform calculations on each group of data.


To round the AVG(SALARY) to the nearest integer in your SQL query, you can use the ROUND() function. The ROUND() function takes two arguments: the value to be rounded and the number of decimal places. For rounding to the nearest integer, you can set the number of decimal places to 0.



In SQL, the LCASE() and UCASE() functions are used to convert text to lowercase and uppercase, respectively.

LCASE(): Converts the text to lowercase.
UCASE(): Converts the text to uppercase.
